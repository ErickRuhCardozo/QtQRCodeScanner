# Long Story Short:

After several \[failed\] attempts to implement [QZXing](https://github.com/ftylitak/qzxing) with Qt 6.6 and CMake, I've decided to do my own "implementation" of [zxing-cpp](https://github.com/zxing-cpp/zxing-cpp) as a sample project. Of course, "implementing" is kind of a vague term, but I think you got what I mean...

It's not by any means a production-ready code, it's more like a POC.. I mean, at least it works \[on my machine \[and my Redmi Note 8\]\] though.

Anyway, if this pile of garbage is of any inspiration to you, feel free to fork or just stole this code (the latter one is at your own risk).

Remember to ```git clone https://github.com/zxing-cpp/zxing-cpp.git``` in the lib directory before build, or change the CMake file accordingly to you project structure.
